# Thermostat Challenge

## Description

This is the result of the fifth week afternoon pair programming challenge at Makers Academy. It is a HTML web page that represents a Thermostat. It uses jQuery and plain JavaScript to update the model based on the user interaction. It also uses CSS to set the temperature colour.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo to your local machine using `git@github.com:EdinaBMakers/thermostat.git`
2. Open index.html in a web browser

## Testing

The Thermostat model has been written in TDD and tested using Jasmine.
